Stock-ify

Stock-ify is the world's first music artist stock exchange!

Project Information:

This is the final project for Phase 2 as part of the Flatiron School's Software Engineering track.  Over the course of a week our team of four has atempted to create the world's first musical stock exchange.  The goal is to add artists to your portfolio at a low price, and sell them at the height of their carriers!  Good luck all!

MVP Overview:
A user can navigate through the lists of current artists on Spotify, 'buy' them and put them onto their record label.  Stock-ify keeps track of number of plays an artists gets over the course of a week and adjusts their 'price' accordingly.  The user can buy and sell their artists to try and gain points and win glory! (no real money is currently used).

As always, be careful, as gambling can result in loss.
